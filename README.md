**** [Neuromorphic Spike Learning System](https://github.com/haoyucn/Async-SNN)  ****
  Developed a spiking neural network (SNN) to study biologically inspired temporal learning and memory efficiency.  
  Achieved O(1) memory complexity for sequence learning compared to O(T) in standard backpropagation, demonstrating potential for low-power continual learning systems.
